(** Representation of a signature. It roughly corresponds to a set of symbols,
    defined in a single module (or file). *)
type t =
  { symbols : (string, symbol) Hashtbl.t
  ; path    : module_path
  ; deps    : (module_path, (string * rule) list) Hashtbl.t }

(* NOTE the [deps] field contains a hashtable binding the [module_path] of the
   required modules, on which the current signature depends, to an association
   list mapping definable symbols (given in these modules) to additional rules
   (defined in the current signature, for symbols defined elsewhere. *)

(** [find sign name] finds the symbol named [name] in [sign] if it exists, and
    raises the [Not_found] exception otherwise. *)
let find : t -> string -> symbol =
  fun sign name -> Hashtbl.find sign.symbols name

(** [loading] contains the [module_path] of the signatures (or files) that are
    being processed. They are stored in a stack due to dependencies. Note that
    the topmost element corresponds to the current module.  If a [module_path]
    appears twice in the stack, then there is a circular dependency. *)
let loading : module_path Stack.t = Stack.create ()

(** [loaded] stores the signatures of the known (already compiled) modules. An
    important invariant is that all the occurences of a single symbol sould be
    physically equal (across different signatures). This requires copying when
    loading an object file. *)
